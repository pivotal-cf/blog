  Pivotal Labs practices a lot of pair programming. We find the benefits it offers for individuals, teams, and entire businesses is a huge driver in a sustainably rapid software development pace. Unfortunately, pairing isn't as simple as putting two engineers in front of the same code. Here are some methods that might help grow your pair programming practice.
title: A Recipe for Successful Pair Programming
---

Pivotal Labs practices a lot of pair programming. We find that, when two experienced pair programmers work together, the productivity of the pair is greater than the two engineers working separately on the same code. Not only that, but pairing is extremely effective at ramping up a new team member, turning that new team member into an experienced developer very quickly.

Pairing helps solve the problem of aligning your team on context, code style, practices, vision, and more. It keeps individual developers focused, engaged, and constantly productive, even on a bad day. And finally, we find that a business that is pairing, especially in conjunction with a robust test-driven development (TDD) discipline, lowers the cost of code changes, reduces waste, and creates predictability.

Unfortunately, pairing isn't as simple as putting two engineers in front of the same code. We've noticed over many, many combined pairing-hours that there are many tangible and less tangible things that contribute to a productive pairing session. If you're looking to try pairing in your software organization, here are some methods that might help grow your pair programming practice.

## Recipe

Serving size: One Pair

### Ingredients
* 2 Engineers
* 1 Computer
* 2 Mice
* 2 Keyboards
* 2 Monitors
* 1 Codebase
* 1 Problem to Solve

### Secret Sauce
* Honesty
* Empathy
* Trust
* Constant communication
* Fast feedback
* Regular breaks
* Sharing
* And caring!

### Directions
1. Set up the *computer* so that *both monitors* show a mirrored display, and each *mouse* and *keyboard* is able to control it.
1. Select any *two engineers* on your team.
1. The pair picks the highest priority *problem* to work on.
1. The pair talks about how they think they should tackle the problem. They will need to agree on a direction before any *code* can get written!
1. The pair takes turns *sharing* control of the mouse and keyboard, *constantly communicating* their thoughts when they have them, and helping each other to solve the problem at hand.
1. The pair runs into a disagreement, so they have to stop coding and have an *honest* chat about the pros and cons of each possible direction. They may pull in another pair next to them to chat about technical decisions, or talk to a product manager or designer to check their understanding of the story.
1. One person in the pair feels pretty good about a possible solution, so the other developer *trusts* her decisions and the pair try it out together so they can get *fast feedback* about whether it's the right direction.
1. One person in the pair is having a rough day, so in a display of *empathy*, the other person asks him if he needs a *break* to talk through anything. After all, pairing is *caring*!
1. After a ping-pong and coffee break, the pair is ready to deliver their story and celebrates their successes together!

## Comments
**Anon E. Mouse** commented: Help! I really want to try this recipe, but my developers aren't co-located. What do I do?

> **Avery & Bella** replied: Sometimes, your developers may not be able to sit together at one computer. While this is less ideal, it can be solved by substituting one computer with two computers, each with a webcam, high-quality headphones, and screen-sharing software. A whole monitor dedicated to just your pair's face is especially effective.

**Super Hacker** commented: What if I'm pairing and I really need to check my email or Facebook? I don't want my pair snooping on my personal info!

> **Avery & Bella** replied: We work hard to limit the need for any one team member to need to respond to email or other messages. If you need to check your messages, get on Facebook, or whatever else you need, tell your pair you need a break during the day. But pairing requires a lot of focus and lack of distractions. Find ways of limiting those distractions for you and your team!

**Concerned Pair** commented: I'm new to my team and I'm always afraid I will just slow down my pair. Should I just take some time alone to ramp up before trying to pair?

> **Avery & Bella** replied: We find pairing is effective when both people are experienced pair programmers, but also equally effective at quickly turning an inexperienced teammate into an experienced one. When paired with a more experienced teammate, you'll be effective at delivering software on day one, and even *more* effective on day 100!

**Internet Critic** commented: I feel like there's no way pairing can be more effective than two smart developers working separately. What gives?

> **Avery & Bella** replied: The secret about the secret sauce of pairing, empathy, trust, constant communication, fast feedback, etc., is that it isn't a secret! These qualities will help any team be more effective at working together to solve problems and deliver better products faster. If a team isn't pairing, they often need to spend lots of additional time and effort to build all of these qualities up. Why not build this into your day, all day, every day? Pairing is a great way to do that!
